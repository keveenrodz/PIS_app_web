Created for students and teachers of the program by a student of the same program.

This is to raise the PIS projects of all the research areas that Bioengineering UdeA has, to be qualified by the project advisors (professors) and to be notified to the bioengineering program and to the students, with the possibility of being a repository of research projects of the bioengineering program.
